<h1>The Mission</h1>
<h2>Bricks Framework</h2>
<p>
    The goal of Bricks is to provide a framework for developing
    to make content management systems available.
    The reason behind this is that a large number of modules and extensions
    exist, but it's always only for a very specific ecosystem
    available - Bricks starts here and offers for developing
    extensions a flexible framework where developers develop an extension
    which is then used in many CMS and e-commerce solutions.
</p>
<p>
    Bricks means that the software has a modular structure and that special attention is paid to it
    that the modules work coherently. We try to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
</p>
<h2>Bricks Content Managment Framework</h2>
<p>
    Bricks wants to be a simple and intuitive solution that can be easily expanded
    primarily for programmers. The CMS based on it should then also be
    operated intuitively by the user as the programmer intended for him.
    Individual and business-oriented.
</p>
<h2>Bricks Content Managmenet System</h2>
<p>
    With the Bricks CMS, an implementation based on the frameworks is implemented.
